# Building the project from source

If you wish to build the project from source, clone the github
repository to your PC.  (You can also download a snapshot of the
github code as a ZIP file and unpack it into a local directory on your
PC.)  The firmware and Windows tools use completely separate build
systems; see below for instructions for each.


## Pico SDK setup

Building the firmware requires the Pico C++ SDK from Raspberry Pi.
For the project's initial development phase, I was using SDK 1.5.1;
shortly before the first release, I migrated to the latest SDK version
at the time, 2.1.0.  In October 2025, for the version 1.0.0 release,
I migrated the release build to SDK 2.2.0.

The full project will currently build against any of those SDK
versions (1.5.1, 2.1.0, or 2.2.0).  Since I'm currently using 2.2.0
for my official release builds, I recommend using that, so that your
environment matches mine - that tends to save a lot of time if you
need to contact me with any questions about the build.


### How to install SDK 2.2.0

For people who want to do command-line builds on Windows (which is how
I build the project), I created a ready-to-install snapshot of my Pico
SDK 2.2.0 build environment for Windows x64, complete with pre-built
binaries of all of the required gcc toolchain and SDK SDK build tools
executables:

* Download it from https://github.com/mjrgh/pico-sdk-2.2.0

* In that repo, open README.MD file, and follow the instructions under **How to Install**

The Pico SDK is also available for Linux and Mac.  Refer to the official
Raspberry Pi SDK release for those platforms.


### How to install SDK 2.1.0

Raspberry Pi moved to a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension for the 2.1.0 SDK,
replacing the Windows command-line build environment used in 1.5.1.
In principle, that should be just as easy to set up, but it still
seems to be a work in progress, so much so that I can't get it to
install on my machine.  In addition, the official 2.1.0 library has a
couple of serious errors, one that will cause an obvious compiler
error when you try to build, and a second, more insidious regression
that will make the USB connection unstable when you deploy the
firmware.

To address the install glitches and library errors, I've create my
own unofficial release bundle of the 2.1.0 SDK for x64 Windows.  My
version is for command-line builds, same as the official 1.5.1 SDK,
and comes with pre-built Windows x64 binaries for all of the required
tools, and **corrected** versions of the library files.  To install:

* Download it from https://github.com/mjrgh/pico-sdk-2.1.0

* Follow the instructions in the README.MD file under **How To Install**

For the download, you can either `git clone` it or download it as a ZIP file.

This is just a snapshot of my own copy of the 2.1.0 SDK, and it's for
x64 Windows only.  If you want to build on Linux or MacOS, go directly
to the Raspberry Pi site and follow their instructions.  However,
<b>you'll still need my corrected library files,</b> because the official
ones contain the errors I mentioned.  You should set up the official
SDK environment per Raspberry Pi's instructions, then replace the
pico-sdk/ subtree with my corrected version from https://github.com/mjrgh/pico-sdk-2.1.0.

### How to install SDK 1.5.1

If you want to go with the tried-and-true 1.5.1, that's easy.
Raspberry Pi provides an official one-click Windows installer, at
https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup-windows/.  Download
and run the installer, and follow the on-screen prompts.

### NMAKE

For any version of the SDK on Windows, you'll also need to install
Microsoft's NMAKE build tool.  That's not included in any of the
pre-built snapshots (mine or the official Raspberry Pi releases)
because it's proprietary Microsoft software.  The easiest way to get
NMAKE is to install Visual Studio, which you'll need to do anyway,
since you'll need it to build the Windows portion of the Pinscape
project (the Config Tool and related software).  The free Community
Edition of Visual Studio is available at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/.

### Pico SDK documentation 

For tons of documentation about how to use the Pico SDK, see
[Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf).
That has instructions for setting up the build environment on other
platforms (Linux, MacOS) if you prefer to work on one of those.
But you won't need to read all of that if you just want to build the
Pinscape firmware, as the instructions below should cover it.

## Building the main Pinscape Pico firmware program

The steps below assume that you've already set up the SDK tools
on Windows as explained above, and assumes that you're using the
command-line build process (as opposed to VS Code or some other IDE).
These steps are only required for the **first build** on a new machine.

* Open a Windows Terminal window (i.e., a CMD prompt/DOS box)

* Set the working directory (`CD`) to your PinscapePico\firmware folder

* Type `c:\pico-sdk-2.1.0\pico-env.cmd` (replacing the path with the actual
location where you installed the Pico SDK files, if it's different)

* `del CMakeCache.txt` and `rmdir /s CMakeFiles` (only needed if those exist from previous builds)

* Type `cmake -S . -G "NMake Makefiles"` (**exactly** as shown, including capitalization and quotes)

* Type `nmake`

That should produce a long series of progress messages from the compiler, hopefully
all bearing good news (no warnings or errors), and ultimately finishing with:

`[100%] Built target PinscapePico`

You should now see a file in the working folder called `PinscapePico.uf2`.  That's
the compiled firmware program, ready for installation onto your Pico.  Install
it on the Pico using the standard procedure for all Pico firmware installs:

* Unplug the Pico from USB (and all other power sources)

* Press **and hold** the button on top of the Pico while plugging in the Pico's USB cable, then release the button

* Copy the UF2 file onto the Pico's Boot Loader virtual thumb drive

If you're already installed Pinscape on the Pico in question, you can
alternatively install the UF2 file through the GUI Config Tool, via
the Update Firmware button on the Device Overview page.  That lets
you skip the BOOTSEL/USB cable maneuvering.

### Re-building

The lengthy procedure above is only required for the first build on a
new machine, to generate the build scripts.  After you go through
those steps once, you can repeat the build simply by typing `nmake`.
That will recompile all source files modified since the last build,
and generate a new .uf2 file.

NMAKE automatically detects which source files are affected by edits
made since the last build, and selectively rebuilds only the affected
parts of the program, so rebuilds tend to be much faster than the
first build.


## Building the PWM Worker firmware

There's a separate firmware program, called PWMWorker, in another folder
(of that name) alongside `firmware`.  This program is designed for use with
the DIY-friendly expansion boards, which use auxiliary Picos to perform the
job of controlling PWM outputs, which we might otherwise do with a dedicated
PWM chip like a TLC59116 if any such chips were available in a DIY-friendly
package.  But all of the PWM chips on the market today are fine-pitch SMD
chips that are difficult to solder by hand, so we use Picos instead.  To
make the auxiliary Picos act like PWM controller chips, we install this
special firmware.

You can build this firmware using the same procedure outlined above
for the main Pinscape firmware.


## Building the Windows programs (GUI Config Tool, Command Line Config Tool, API libraries)

All of the Windows programs can be built through a single Visual Studio "solution" (.sln)
file.  The process is fully automatic once you load the .sln into Visual Studio.

* Install Visual Studio 2022 or later.  Community Edition is free;
download it from the official Microsoft site at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/.

* Launch Visual Studio

* Click **Open a project or solution**

* In the file selector, navigate  to your PinscapePico folder, and select **PinscapePico.sln**

* Select **Build** > **Build Solution** on the main menu
